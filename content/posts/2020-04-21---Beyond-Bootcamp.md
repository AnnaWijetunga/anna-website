Flatiron's software engineering bootcamp was a hoot, but word on the street is, it's just the beginning.

With graduation so-close-I-can-smell-it, it's time to set new goals to keep the momentum going and also find a job in this bright and shiny field.

Things to figure out:

1) What type of job am I looking for?

2) With Ruby, JavaScript and a handful of frameworks under my belt, what should I learn next?

No lack of things to do to answer those q's, so I'll scoot off to figure out the details. Catch you next time with the update on where I'm heading next.

[Get in touch](/pages/contacts) any time.
